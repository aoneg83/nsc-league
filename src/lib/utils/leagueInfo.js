  <p>Founded in Las Vegas back in 2010, the National Scumbag League brings together 12 football enthusiasts each year, not just for the glory and bragging rights, but let’s be honest—mostly for the draft and an excuse to get drunk.</p>
  <p>Sure, the league is about building the best roster, making smart moves, and talking football, but let’s be honest—it's the draft day antics and the good times with friends that keep us coming back year after year. Over the seasons, we've seen epic matchups, unforgettable victories, and plenty of questionable decisions—on and off the field.</p>
  <p>Ready to make your mark this season? Stay tuned for the latest standings, matchups, and league news. And as always—may the best Scumbag win!</p>
